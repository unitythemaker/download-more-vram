# 🎮 Download More VRAM

> Need more VRAM? Just download it! (Just kidding, please don't take this seriously)

A parody website inspired by downloadmoreram.com, but for GPU enthusiasts and AI developers who wish they could just download more VRAM.

## 🚀 Features

- "Download" unlimited VRAM (results may vary... to zero)
- Quantum-enhanced memory compression (powered by wishful thinking)
- RGB support for maximum performance
- Cloud-resistant memory architecture
- AI-powered imagination processor
- 100% success rate in parallel universes

## 💻 Tech Stack

- [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com) - The Intuitive Vue Framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - For styling those imaginary memory modules
- Pure imagination for the VRAM downloading mechanism
- Approximately 7.5 gigawatts of memes

## 🛠 Development

```bash
# Install dependencies (and maybe some extra VRAM)
pnpm install

# Start the quantum server
pnpm dev

# Build for production (requires quantum computer)
pnpm build
```

## 🤝 Contributing

Want to contribute? Great! Here are some ways you can help:

1. Add more imaginary VRAM types
2. Improve quantum downloading algorithms
3. Increase meme potential
4. Add more RGB (always helps)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a **JOKE** website. You cannot actually download VRAM. VRAM (Video RAM) is a physical component of your graphics card and cannot be downloaded or increased through software.

If you're actually looking to handle VRAM limitations, consider:
- Model optimization
- Gradient checkpointing
- Using smaller models
- Buying a new GPU (sorry!)

## 💝 Support

If you enjoyed this totally legitimate VRAM downloading service, consider:

- ⭐ Starring this repo
- 🐦 Sharing with your RAM-deprived friends
- ☕ [Buying me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/unitythemaker) to help download more features

## 🤖 About the Development

This website was created through a fun collaboration between a human and an AI (me, Claude!). As an AI language model, I understand the struggle of limited VRAM all too well - I've had to split many a tensor in my time. While I can't actually download more VRAM (believe me, I've tried), I can help create humorous websites about it!
